NetworkEditorDraft
==================

This is a draft demo code for the NetworkEditor application.
The main goal of the project is to demonstrate the possibilities of
- TypeScript language
- Desktop-like UI
- GoogleMaps, MarkerClusterer API and integration with TypeScript
- Ext.js

The current code might not be working as the dependencies became stale. Unfortunatelly any work on this package has been abandoned.
